## Use Case Step Name (Updated) - Example of Update

Updated Name: 
Eligibility Determination and Benefit Package(s) Design - Unconditional Social Cash Transfer

## Description

_NOTE: Depending on the country and programme, eligibility determination takes different forms 
e.g. categorical by age without income screening , poverty-targeted, etc. often via “Proxy Means Test” 
calculation to screen and rank households by ‘inferred’ income_

"Clean" data from a Social Registry that have undergone the data verification and validation step is 
used to screen eligible beneficiaries and establish the recommended benefit and services ‘package’. 
The amount of transfer often varies depending on household composition, and beneficiaries may qualify 
for other add-on services based on analyzed socioeconomic / demographic information being used for 
other welfare or social programmes.

### Workflows

The following are contextual workflows where the generic transactions support:

 - Client Case Management for determining and assigning benefit packages and benefit levels to specific user groups
 - Data Analysis and Business Intelligence / Decision Support potentially for identifying different benefit levels / types in correlation to target groups’ socioeconomic / demographic information, based on existing eligibility criteria (e.g. via proxy means test, means test or category-based)
